            <p>We CSS3 ninjas like to push the boundaries of web design, which means we get to dance on the bleeding edge of supported code. Unfortunately, everyday ordinary citizens and their old & outdated browser software may not be as "fresh" as us.</p>
            <p>Fear not, there's a CSS3 rule that recognizes the downfalls of the everyday ordinary browsing citizen, and rectifies the problem, leaving the user blissfully unaware of our epic-ness.</p>
            <h4>Enter the @supports rule</h4>
            <p>It's simple, really. Just use the @supports rule to to check a CSS <code>property: value</code> pair, like so...</p>
<pre>
  <code>
@supports (border-radius: 100px) {
  .fresh {
    border-radius: 100px;
  }
}
  </code>
</pre>
            <p>If the browser understands, it will generate the style within the curly braces, otherwise, it'll move on... Like a chump.</p>
